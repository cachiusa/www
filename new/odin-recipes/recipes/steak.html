    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This tasty steak hash was simple to make, tasted fantastic, and we both loved it! I know what I’ll be making with
        our leftover steak from now on!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of potatoes, diced</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1½ – 2 cups of leftover steak, diced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp leftover caramelized onion, optional</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Paprika, to taste</li>
        <li>3 steamed eggs, if desired</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté the steak, seasoned to taste, in olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat for about 3-4
            minutes per side, or to your desired degree of doneness.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let it rest for 5-7 minutes before dicing.</li>
        <li>Boil the diced potatoes in water for 4-5 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat</li>
        <li>Add the onion and sauté for 2 minutes, then add the potatoes</li>
        <li>Push the potatoes down in the pan with your spatula and leave them alone for 3-4 minutes. Flip the potatoes
            to brown on the other side. Continue to leave the potatoes alone for 3-4 minutes before flipping.</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes and onions are golden brown, add the diced steak and caramelized onions and heat through.
        </li>
        <li>Season with paprika, sea salt, and freshly cracked pepper, to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve your steak hash with an egg on top. Serve immediately. Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
